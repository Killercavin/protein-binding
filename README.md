# 🧬 Smart Protein Binding and Molecular Screening System

This project is an AI-driven web application designed to enhance early-stage drug discovery by enabling intelligent protein-ligand interaction prediction, molecular visualization, and collaborative research. It streamlines key discovery tasks such as molecular structure generation, 3D modeling, compound search, and team collaboration — all within a unified, intuitive interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔬 **3D Molecular Visualization** using WebGL-based libraries
- 🧪 **Molecule Generator** using SMILES notation
- 📊 **AI-Powered Molecular Screening** via integrated models such as NVIDIA Molmin
- 💬 **Real-Time Group Messaging & Collaboration**
- 🌐 **Compound Search and Interactive Dashboards**
- 🌙 **Light/Dark Mode Support for Accessibility**
- 🔐 **Secure User Authentication and Group Management**
